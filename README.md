    Ki Framework
    
    -- A Statechart Framework for Sproutcore

#Overview

Ki provides statecharts that support:

  * Nesting of states for hierarchy
  * Parallel states for orthogonality
  
The framework's design was closely based on David Harel's origin paper ["Statecharts: A Visual Formalism For Complex Systems"](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/papers/Statecharts.pdf).
