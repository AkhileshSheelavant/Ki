    Ki Framework
    
    -- A Statechart Framework for Sproutcore

#Overview

Ki is a framework that provides statecharts supporting:

  * Hierarchy by nesting states within states
  * Orthogonality by making states parallel to each other
  
The framework's design was closely based on David Harel's original paper ["Statecharts: A Visual Formalism For Complex Systems"](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/papers/Statecharts.pdf).
